Quick start

Input variables
Input variables and related references were listed in ‘InputParameters. xlsx’
'3PPF_outputV231_rep2_05-12. txt' and '3PPF_outputV231_rep2_12-19.txt' were generated by the RayTracer (Song et al., 2013), which contains 3D leaf structure and light distribution. 

Output
The cumulative net CO2 assimilation of the soybean canopy of the whole day and every 10min were saved in the two output .txt file, separately. 
The output data was summarized in ‘OutputSummary.xlsx’ 

Simulation

simulations were conducted in MATLAB (2017b)
1.	Start Matlab
2.	Run simRca.m for Rca related simulations
3.	And run simNPQ.m for NPQ related simulations
